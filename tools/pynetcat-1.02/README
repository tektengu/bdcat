This is a collection of programs for sending data across a network to
another host.  It can be used as part of a pipeline, effectively extending
the pipe to another host.  Great for backups or recoveries, especially
on stripped-down floppy systems that have python but not other tools
(like SSH).

For example:

    (on machine b) pynetcat in '' 1234 | gzip -9 > machinea-backup.tar.gz
    (on machine a) tar c / | pynetcat out backuphost 1234

In the above example, '' specifies that the server should listen on all
addresses on the local machine.

There is also a pass-through which works like a simple, unencrypted SSH,
but without encryption.  Run it as:

   (on machine b) ./pyncrshd -v 1234 ''
   (on machine a) rsync -e 'python pyncrsh 1234' . 10.9.8.7:/tmp/foo
